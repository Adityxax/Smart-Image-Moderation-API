# 🧠 Smart Image Moderation & Analysis API

*A full-stack, async, Dockerized, ML-powered image analysis platform*

A production-style system that allows users to upload an image and receive real-time insights including NSFW detection, face counting, OCR text extraction, and image quality metrics — all backed by an asynchronous, containerized ML pipeline and a modern frontend dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Image Analysis

* 🔞 **NSFW / Sensitive Content Detection** (HSV-based heuristic)
* 🧍 **Face Detection** (OpenCV DNN – SSD Caffe model)
* 🔤 **OCR Text Extraction** (EasyOCR)
* 🌀 **Blur Detection** (Laplacian variance)
* 📐 **Image Quality Scoring** (resolution + sharpness)
* ⚡ **Processing Time Tracking**
* 🧪 **Model Metadata Reporting**

### System Capabilities

* 🔁 **Asynchronous ML Processing** (Celery + Redis)
* 📦 **Fully Dockerized Architecture**
* 🖥️ **Frontend Dashboard** (Next.js + Tailwind)
* 🛠️ **Dev / Prod Environment Separation**
* 🚦 **Health Checks + Service Orchestration**

---

## 🧩 The Idea

Build a **hosted API + frontend dashboard** where users can upload an image and receive:

* NSFW / sensitive content flag
* Face count
* OCR-extracted text
* Image quality metrics (blur + resolution)
* Processing time and model metadata

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔹 Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind)

* Upload UI with image preview
* Polling-based live status updates
* Styled results dashboard
* Custom fonts (Bungee + Roboto Condensed)
* Themed UI with blur, glow, gradients, and purple-glass cards

### 🔹 Backend (FastAPI)

* REST API:

  * `POST /upload` → Upload image and queue job
  * `GET /result/{job_id}` → Fetch processing status/results
  * `GET /health` → Service health check

### 🔹 Async Task System

* **Celery** → Background ML processing
* **Redis** → Message broker + result backend
* ML runs in workers, not in the API thread

### 🔹 ML Pipeline (CPU-Only, Production-Safe)

* OpenCV DNN → Face detection
* EasyOCR → Text extraction
* Heuristic NSFW scoring → HSV skin-tone detection
* Blur detection → Laplacian variance
* Quality scoring → Resolution + sharpness formula

### 🔹 Docker

Multi-container setup:

* `smart_api` → FastAPI server
* `smart_worker` → Celery ML worker
* `smart_redis` → Redis broker
* Dev + Prod Docker Compose configs

---

## 🔄 Processing Flow

### Upload Flow

1. User uploads an image
2. FastAPI:

   * Saves file to `/uploads`
   * Generates a `job_id`
   * Queues a Celery task
3. Returns `job_id` instantly

### Worker Flow

1. Celery worker:

   * Lazy-loads ML models
   * Runs:

     * Face detection
     * OCR
     * Blur scoring
     * NSFW heuristic
2. Packages result as JSON
3. Stores output in Redis

### Result Flow

Frontend polls:

```http
GET /result/{job_id}
```

Until:

```json
status = "success"
```

Then renders:

* NSFW status
* Faces detected
* OCR text
* Blur score
* Quality score
* Processing time
* Model metadata

---

## 🧪 ML Pipeline Design

### Face Detection

* OpenCV SSD (Caffe model)
* Confidence thresholding
* Lightweight and CPU-friendly

### OCR

* EasyOCR (English)
* Auto model caching via Docker volume

### Blur Detection

* Laplacian variance

  * High = sharp
  * Low = blurry

### NSFW Heuristic

* HSV skin-tone masking
* Pixel ratio scoring
* Threshold-based classification

### Quality Score

* Combines:

  * Resolution
  * Sharpness
* Normalized and capped at `1.0`

---

## 🎨 Frontend Evolution

### Started As

> “Choose file. Button. Black screen.”

### Ended As

* Themed galaxy-style background
* Gradient + blur overlay
* Purple-glass cards
* Image preview panel
* Hover-glow buttons
* Clean results dashboard

### UX Features

* Upload preview
* Disabled + loading states
* Error handling
* Structured result layout

This turned a backend tool into a **demo-ready product**.

---

## 🐳 DevOps & Docker
